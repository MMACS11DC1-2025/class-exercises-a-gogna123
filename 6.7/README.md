# Day 1
Today I chose my project theme: analyzing fire images to estimate the size of a fire.
1. I added 10 fire-related images into the 6.7/Images folder, including bonfires, forest fires, house fires, and explosions.
2. I wrote the first version of the program, which loads each image and calculates the percentage of orange pixels and white pixels. 
3. This will later determine how large the fire is. I also worked on accurately using rgb values to get the best results.
4. By the end of today, the program was successfully printing the orange and white pixel percentages for every image.

# Day 2 plan:
1. Combine orange + white percentages into one “fire intensity score”
2. Create if-statements to label each fire as Small, Medium, Large, or Extreme
